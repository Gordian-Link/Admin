## Meeting Minutes
### Becoming a business
- Obtaining a general partnership 
- Being registered in the Netherlands
- Unsure about if Ivan is able to be registered due to international policy.
- Will have to obtain extra information

### Website
 #### Wix
 - If use Wix --> We will be stuck in their environment
 - Easy to use
 - Expensive when considering the fact that we have to keep paying

#### Manual
- Harder to maintain
- Need to register domain and use a hosting service (Dream Host) individually
- Not bound by any service (+ & -)
- Might be very hard to do things like member login and security


### Node
- Suss out setting up a server or utilising a SaaS based one
- Want have a node made by the end of summer (Northern Hemisphere)
- Got a bit into depth about Yoel's idea about the business progression. 
- Want to have a high profile trusted node


### Misc.
- Sign up into the Chainlink commerce
- Make a business plan
- Finalise decision on the approach that we need to develop in order for there to be a successful integration into the market
- In order to integrate both applications and consultancy, depending on the types of clients we get in the beginning we can start with consulting but we can potentially create packages in order to 'solve' the problems. Then we can just do a license based approach (Infosys, Oracle, etc.)
- Sell data, providing data feed, etc. as a separate feed of income as an additional option.
