#### Attendees: Ivan, Yoel, Cornelis
## Meeting Minutes
### Discussing ideas suggestions from previous meetings

####	Yoel
- An exchange that utilities price feeds from the aggregated data provided buy chainlink.
-	Use smart contracts as a form of stop losses and derivative trading 
-	Good way to get into how these things work in the back-end as well as allowing for an exchange to be built 
-	If we have our reserve in test net, then we are able to attract investors and create a 'practice' trading platform.
-	Provide online education (edutainmaint) for how to provide trades (courses, etc.)
-	Diagram state machines of the contract (goes together with my thing of digitalising the PDF contract)

####	Cornelis
- Applying Yoel's ideas to real world commodities (think Plus500)
- 

####	Ivan
- Migrating data to a DLT platform using chainlink (Database management as a service)
- Transcribing/Converting regular contract data in to a smart contract form (i.e. Digitilisation)
- Payment flow between currencies (think paypal but without the exorbitant fees)
- Pay with X services being incorporated through chainlink for easy access to discounts (think Honey)
	- 'World Wide Wallet'.
	- Fees and conversion rates etc. to be discussed as the user will be fucked with transactions. 
-   Escrow based payment on delivery (Example already exists, UX does not however)
